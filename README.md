## SWOT Analysis

Strengths:
I understand the basic and scope of p2 project and have a good idea of how my app will function as well
as a basic understanding of how to use CRUD and components.

Weaknesses:
Probably my biggest weakness will be styling cause it takes me the longest or some of the concepts 
I'm still shakey with such as update, delete and class components. Also I struggle with errors/bugs. 

Opportunities:
This project will allow me to play around and get my hands on the code and solidfy my memory and knowledge
of jsx, components, crud etc. 

Threats:
Time, errors, and new features or concepts are my threats. Errors and new concepts 
are my biggest issues and will probably take some help which I don't ask alot of.
